YU-GI-OH! Memory Game

This is a project for the odin project assignment in the react course (link: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card)

What i practiced with this project: 
- I reinforced my understanding of state in react and the react rendering in general
- I practiced using useEffect hook to fetch data from an external API
- This time (in contrast to the CV app) i approached the development of this project with a plan i made on paper. So i practiced planning and creating a mental contruct of what i want to build ahead of coding. Which is a huge win for me!!!

What i want to change/improve in the future: 
- I definitly want to improve styling, as it is very raw tight now (as with most of my apps):
 * add an animation to the h1 title
 * add a tilt to the cards on hover (i actually did it during developmet with react-tilt library, but i didn't like the effect of trembling when hovering the edge of the card)
 * add a nice background image
- I want to add a start game/ end game components (right now the score will change to 0 when you hit your 13th card)
